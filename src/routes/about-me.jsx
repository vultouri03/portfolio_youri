                                My name is Youri de Gier, I'm a Dutch student at Hogeschool Rotterdam, majoring in Creative Media and Game Technologies.

                                I'm 20 years old and have completed the VWO, the highest level of Highschool in the Netherlands, in the following subjects: Mathematics A, Dutch, English, Science, Physics, Biology, Art and German.
                            </p>

                                I've chosen my current Study because of my interest in both programing and design. Which is something this study perfectly combines.

                            <p>
                                I have quite a few different hobbies I participate in during my freetime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first of those is playing Video Games. This hobby is the one that sparked my interest in learing how to code and get better at problem solving.
                            </p>
                            <p>This has recently evolved in me learning how to make Games in the game engine known as Godot.</p>
                            <p>I also spend a lot of my freetime drawing and practicing art. This is a hobby that I have had since I was young and most definitly sparked my interest in design.</p>
                            <p className="pb-16">I also like taking strolls around my hometown from time to time, and also read from time to time.</p>
